- Toggle scale visibility
- Helps interpret temperature ranges
- Calibrated to common thermal camera ranges

### 5. Saving Results
- Click "Save Image" button
- Choose save location and format
- Enhanced image saves with all applied effects

## Understanding Enhancement Options

### 1. Histogram Equalization
![Histogram Example](https://i.imgur.com/tHeOXqA.png)

**What it does:**
- Improves contrast by spreading intensity values
- Best for images with poor contrast
- Shows more detail in dark/bright areas

**When to use:**
- Images appear too dark or bright
- Details are hard to see
- Temperature differences are subtle

### 2. Contrast Stretching
![Contrast Example](https://i.imgur.com/crMiBnC.png)

**What it does:**
- Expands intensity range to full scale
- Maintains relative temperature differences
- Creates clearer separation between temperatures

**When to use:**
- Image looks flat or gray
- Need to highlight temperature differences
- Want to preserve relative temperature relationships

### 3. Adaptive Equalization
![Adaptive Example](https://i.imgur.com/WTEspty.png)

**What it does:**
- Enhances local contrast
- Improves detail in all image areas
- Prevents over-enhancement

**When to use:**
- Image has varying brightness regions
- Need to see details in all areas
- Complex scenes with multiple temperature zones

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Image Selection**
   - Use clear, well-focused images
   - Ensure good lighting in original image
   - Higher resolution images work better

2. **Enhancement Selection**
   - Start with basic thermal conversion
   - Try histogram equalization first
   - Use adaptive equalization for complex scenes
   - Experiment with different colormaps

3. **Common Issues and Solutions**
   - Noisy output ‚Üí Try different enhancement
   - Too bright/dark ‚Üí Adjust contrast
   - Unclear details ‚Üí Change colormap
   - Poor contrast ‚Üí Apply histogram equalization

## Performance Notes

- Processes images up to 4K resolution
- Real-time preview for most operations
- Larger images may take longer to process
- Recommended: Close other applications for better performance
